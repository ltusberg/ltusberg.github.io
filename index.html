  	<p>My name is Lisa Tusberg and I am a new student of San Mateo Community College. I began my career in graphic design, branding, and advertising. Later in my career, I  transitioned into working as a front-end web designer and developer utilizing a diverse set of frameworks and content management systems. My purpose is to create meaningful, cutting-edge, insightful user experiences that scale across device platforms. My work experience includes the entire design/development process from creating translating business requirements to designing/coding the finished product.
